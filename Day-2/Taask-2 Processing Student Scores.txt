Use Case: Processing Student Scores
Read a list of student scores.
Calculate the average score.
Determine if each student passed or failed based on a threshold (e.g., 60).
Print the results for each student.

Sample Output
-----------
Enter student score (negative number to end): 85
Student 1: Score = 85, Result = Passed
 
Enter student score (negative number to end): 42
Student 2: Score = 42, Result = Failed
--

--
Enter student score (negative number to end): 65
Student 10: Score = 65, Result = Passed
 
Enter student score (negative number to end): -1
Average Score: 69.2

Req: 1. ip: Score, process: compare score, cal Avg, print Op condition on -ve score loop exit
