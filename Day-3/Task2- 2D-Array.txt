
Task2: Single-D Array

create a 2D array to store marks of n students, present in 'n' classrooms.
Number of students and classrooms need to be taken as input from the user
marks of each student need to be taken as input from the user
Display the marks of all studnets different classrooms wise

Output:
Enter total number of classrooms: 2
Enter total number of students: 3

Enter the marks of student-1 from classroom-1: 99
Enter the marks of student-2 from classroom-1: 73
Enter the marks of student-3 from classroom-1: 86

Enter the marks of student-1 from classroom-2: 93
Enter the marks of student-2 from classroom-2: 85
Enter the marks of student-3 from classroom-2: 81

Recored marks of students From Classroom-1 are: 99, 73, 86
Recored marks of students From Classroom-2 are: 93,85, 81
