Task: 5

Use Case 5: Number Guessing Game
------------------------------------------
Requirements:
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number (e.g., 10 attempts).
The program provides feedback if the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
The user can choose to play again after each game.
Implement the game logic using for, while, and do-while loops and conditional constructs like if and switch.
